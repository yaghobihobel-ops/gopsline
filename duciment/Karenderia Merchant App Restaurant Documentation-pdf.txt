How to build PWA
To build your PWA you need to install first Node.js and NPM first and Visual studio code.
Quasar framework requires Node 14+ for Quasar CLI with Vite
Guide for node.js and npm installation https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows
Download visual studio here https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Important: PWA works only with SSL so make sure your site has SSL installed example
https://yourserver.com
• First we need to install some extension for visual studio code, in your visual studio code
Under File -> preferences -> extension -> search and install the following
- Vetur by Pine Wu
- ESLint
- Vue Volar extension Pack
• Extract the MobileVue.zip
• In your visual studio code add the folder MobileVue to workspace
• Open new terminal in your visual studio code on the project MobileVue
• In your terminal run this command npm install -g @quasar/cli
• Run this command npm install
• Login to admin panel and locate Mobile merchant on the sub menu Settings => API Access click
on Generate api keys..
Copy the Mobile API URL, Payment API URL and Mobile API keys, now open up your vue files
And open the file src/api/config.js
And simply set the value for the following
api_base_url = API URL
api_payment_url = Payment API URL
api_token = Mobile API Keys
• It’s very important that don’t change the value of topic and channel
• Finally we build the PWA app by running this command in your terminal quasar build -m pwa or
if you want to run in debug mode for development run quasar dev -m pwa
• Once the build is success you will find a folder in MerchantVue/dist/pwa
copy the files inside pwa to your website host and you can simply now access your pwa app
example https://yourserver.com . please use sub domain and don’t copy the pwa files to sub
folder. Do not copy pwa folder, copy all the files inside MerchantVue/dist/pwa folder
example of sub domain https://pwa.yourserver.com
• Finish
Note : if command quasar command does not work you need to open up your command prompt and
run it as administrator and execute this command
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
How to build Android
To build android app you need to install android studio first always install the latest android studio.
Follow this guide https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/developing-capacitor-apps/preparation
Note: follow only the guide step 1 installation
Before doing this make sure your already set your api_base_url , api_payment_url and api_token
In src/ src/api/config.js under build pwa section.
This guide below only to show how to quick build the app in android, to fully complete build you need to
change all the configuration to yours such as providing firebase project for push, google login , social
login etc. follow the guide under configuring your android application.
• In your Visual Studio code open a terminal with your project MerchantVue
and cd to src-capacitor folder by typing cd src-capacitor once you inside the src-capacitor folder
and run the command npm install
• To quick run the app in android we first run it with development mode
By running this command quasar dev -m capacitor -T android
This will open up your android studio if you already have configure your device emulator just
click play button to run the app in your android emulator.
Also you can run it with your actual mobile phone by connecting your device to your computer
And make sure the developer options is enabled in your phone, you can find many video how to
turn on developer options in your phone such as this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn4bRTFicZw
• Finally once your app is completed you can build the app by running this command
quasar build -m capacitor -T android –d
once build is done open up your android studio and open the project src-capacitor/android, or
if you already run the dev command you probably already open the files, all of you have to do is
sign the app, go to your android studio and locate Build -> generate signed bundle / apk
and provide your keystore on next page.

Merchant app
In this section I will guide you to the quick minimal setup information that needed to run your pwa app
and mobile app.
Login to your merchant panel
• Fill your website details
o Go to site merchant -> information
and fill merchant information tab and address
• Set your google API keys
o Merchant -> settings -> Map api keys
Choose google maps as provider and enter your Geocoding API Key and Google Maps
JavaScript API.
You can go here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-
service/get-api-key on how to get your google api key
You can create or start your google projects here
https://console.developers.google.com
The following API should be enabled in your google projects
1. Distance Matrix API
2. Geocoding API
3. Maps Javascript API
4. Places API
5. Maps Static API
Things to note when creating google api:
1. you cannot restrict the api key for Geocoding API Key as this key does not show
anwhere in your website.
2. For Google Maps JavaScript API you can restrict this to your domain or server I.p address
3. Make sure you enabled your google billing account.
4. In the new version of karenderia the call to google api is lessen compared to old version.
Only the api will be called if necessary
• Merchant -> Search mode
In this section you can set your default country
• Merchant -> Settings -> Login & Signup
In this section you set how your customer register to your website
• Merchant -> -> Settings -> Phone settings
Set your default phone country code

• Merchant -> notifications settings
Set the email address and phone number that will receive notifications if there is new order
• Payment Gateway
In order to receive order from customer you need to add or enabled payment gateway.
Navigate to admin panel -> Payment gateway and from here you can see the list of available
Payment gateway for karenderia
o Choose one of the payment gateway example stripe click edit on the pencil icon ,
Once edit you will see the form that ask for Payment API credentials just set your stripe
api like Secret key Publishable key and webhook signing secret key
o Enabled payment gateway to merchant.
In order to enabled a payment gateway to merchant navigate to Merchant -> list and
choose the merchant you need to edit and go to Payment settings -> enabled your
desire payment gateway and click save.
Things to note: karenderia has 2 different types of merchants
Commission and membership
▪ Commission
This type of merchant will sale an item in your site and all payment will go to
your account like stripe paypal etc, in short all payments will be collected by
website owner.
▪ Membership
Merchant will pay a plan subscription like monthly yearly etc
And all payments will go straight to merchant account.
A video will tutorial can be found for this in video tutorial sections on how to
configure payment gateway.

Troubleshooting
Here are the common mistakes when single web app does not work.
• some server does not return bearer token
- Soulution is to edit the .htaccess and add RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
- RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1] after RewriteEngine On
example
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
• API blocking request
- When generating api keys make sure you’re in your website domain url
• Cannot execute quasar command
- Make sure you installed NPM and quasar cli in your local computer, quasar requires node+12
