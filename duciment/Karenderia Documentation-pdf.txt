How to activate your license
Steps are
• Open this link in your browser http://bastisapp.com/activation/
• In the respective fields, put your Name, E-mail, CodeCanyon Username, Purchase Key and your
domain
• Click activate
• You can change the activation later from this same form. Activating a Regular license again with
another domain name will remove the activation of the previous domain

Where can I find the purchase code
• Login into your envato market account
• Hover the mouse over your username at the top of the screen.
• Click 'Downloads' from the drop-down menu.
• Click 'License certificate & purchase code' (available as PDF or text file).
If you still cannot find it envato has a video and image preview where to get it
Go to this link https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Is-MyPurchase-CodeHow to install script
To install the script follow the steps below.
• Create a new database from your server MySQL database
• Create a DB user to the database and link that database to the DB user.
• Extract the downloaded .zip file from codecanyon on your PC. You’ll find a zip file named
install.zip after extracting
• Upload the Install.zip file to your server public_html or subdomain directory you intend to
• run the script.
• Check the following folder permission make sure the permission is set to 755 or 777 in the
following path /upload , /protected/runtime , backoffice/protected/runtime
• Set your database credentials open the file k-config.php set the value for DB_NAME ,
DB_USER , DB_PASSWORD and DB_HOST.
• Then, navigate your site URL example http://yourserver.com/backoffice/install in your browser
and it will automatically take you to the installation wizard.
• Click on the Start Installation Process
• You will get the Checking File Permission page. If everything is ok then click on Go to the next
step.
• Now you need to import the SQL file
• Now fill up the information of the shop and click Continue.
• Click on Go to Home/ Login to the admin panel.
Important: if you installing to a sub folder you need to update the .htaccess file with sub folder that you
created both in main folder and backoffice folder
Best practice when going live
By default debug is ON to see the errors in your website this is good idea when your debugging your
application but when going live we don’t want others to see errors and server details.
• Open the file index.php and remove the line defined('YII_DEBUG') or define('YII_DEBUG',true);
• Also we need to remove this in backoffice panel open the file backoffice/index.php and remove
defined('YII_DEBUG') or define('YII_DEBUG',true);
• Deleting the installer controller file in backoffice/controller/InstallerController.php
• Change the CRON_KEY value in k-config.php
By default there is cron key set this is a unique key in order to protect any cron jobs in your
server so no one can execute the cron outside your server.
CRON_KEY value should not not have spaces or special character create your random keys in
https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha1-hash-generator/
Changing Back office URL
By default back office url is http://yourserver.com/backoffice/admin
If you want to change this url to something like http://yourserver.com/myoffice/admin
Please follow the steps below.
• First rename the folder backoffice to myoffice
Take note the folder should not have spaces example /my office this will not work
It should be like /my-office or myoffice
• open the file k-config.php change the value of BACKOFFICE_FOLDER
example : define( 'BACKOFFICE_FOLDER', myoffice );
• open the file myoffice/.htaccess change the folder name backoffice to myoffice
example :
RewriteBase /myoffice
RewriteRule . /myoffice/index.php [L]
• now you should be able to access your backend with the new URL
http://yourserver.com/myoffice/admin
How to download the latest version
• Login to your Codecanyon account.
• Hover over your username from the top right corner and click ‘Downloads’ from the drop-down
menu
• The downloads section displays a list of all the items purchased using your account Click the
‘Download’ button next to the item and select ‘Main File(s)’ which contains all
• The downloads section displays a list of all the items purchased using your account Click the
‘Download’ button next to the item and select ‘Main File(s)’ which contains all files, or ‘Licence
Certificate and Purchase Code’ for the item licence information only.
How to upgrade to the latest version
For now if your using the old kmrs there is no way to update this, the database has changes in terms of
table structure , stay tune I will release a free addon for migration.
I advise you to install this new karenderia to separate sub domain or new folder in your server to get
familiars with the new version.
Important: since this new update version 2 it has new codes most of your addon will not work anymore
So if your already live and using mobile app I advise you to not update until those said addon is also
updated.
Update New karenderia Version 2
• Extract the downloaded file from codecanyon.
• There you will get a zipped folder named ‘updates.zip’. Upload that to the root directory on
your server in which your previous version is running. Unzip that updates.zip file by selecting
“Extract here”.
• Now visit the update URL example http://yourserver.com/backoffice/update
You should see the update page, to update simply click ‘Update Now’
• Finish

anwhere in your website.
2. For Google Maps JavaScript API you can restrict this to your domain or server I.p address
3. Make sure you enabled your google billing account.
4. In the new version of karenderia the call to google api is lessen compare to old version.
